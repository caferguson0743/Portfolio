									<h1>Life Beyond the Analyst<br />
									</h1>
									<p>Summary of where my passion for this work comes from and all the things I like to do when I am not analyzing data or making dashboards.</p>
								</header>

								<h2>My Map is a Maze!</h2>
									<p>
										Everyone has a time in their life where there journey to discover begins. Looking back, my map looks more like a maze than a well-planned road trip with all the stops and milestones clearly placed along the way. I knew I needed to have a career that would allow me to be analytical and being part of a team to solve problems and achieve success, just didn't know what that was.</p>
										
										<p>My first experience with coding was in college, where I took a course in Visual Basic (..I know you are trying to guess the year!) as an elective for my Mathemetics degree. This was the first time I realized how algorithms were the conduit between mathematics and computer science. Since then, I have been incorporating business analyst and data analyst philosophies into my work and have been able to solve complex problems and deliver solutions.</p>
										<h2>Passion for Learning</h2>
										My passion for learning drives me every day to learn everthing! I have gained both informal and formal education credentials that range from Master of Science degrees to a plethera of Udemy and LinkedIn Learning courses. It is challenging some times to explain to others why I take so many classes. It is purely because I want to learn so I can do the work. My passion for problem solving is what drives me to learn relationships between data, explore interactions, and solve problems through modeling and visualization. I feel now is the time we need to start building networks and relationships with data like we do with people.</p>
										
										<h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
										<p>I am completely and 100% addicted to Pickleball! I play 3-4 days a week and sometimes that is not enough. It is not just the sport that is addicting to me, it is the drive to keep getting better. Like any sport, Pickleball is a game that is both internally and externally competitive. Winning the game doesn't always mean I played my best, just like losing doesn't mean I totally sucked! There is always something to improve on and the game draws in like-minded people.</p>
										
										<p>When I am not playing Pickleball, I am volunteering at different events through my church. I am an elected member on the Mission & Outreach committee and a volunteer member on various other committees. I sign up for any and all events that I can depending on my schedule. Giving my time is rewarding and it also keeps my grounded to know what is important in life.
										
										<p>I have two Mini Australian Shepherds that get all of my attention whenever they think they need it. I love them and I think everyone in the world should have at least one. <a href="#">link</a>.</p>
										<h2>Send Me a Message</h2>
										<p>Feel free to reach out to me with any questions or comments. I am always looking to connect with others who share my passion for data and analytics. I am also open to any recommendations for improving my portolio. Keep growing and learning! </p>
